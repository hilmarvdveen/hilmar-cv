Since developers used Angular, React, or Vue, and the documentation was often incomplete or outdated, integration issues and inconsistent behavior arose across projects. I analyzed all components and rewrote the technical documentation in Confluence, including framework-specific examples, edge cases, and limitations. I also created wrappers and polyfills to ensure compatibility with Angular, React, and Vue. For missing functionality, I provided temporary bridge components linked to deprecation tickets. I acted as the technical liaison between UX designers, frontend teams, and the central BOLD team.

The frontend was structured around a component-based, data-driven architecture with a central canvas, a left panel for navigation and form blocks, and a right panel for component configuration. Users could drag components onto the canvas and edit them inline. When a component was selected, the right panel displayed tabs for editing properties (like labels, validations, conditions, and dependencies), adding comments, and managing versions. I also worked on the backend: I extended API endpoints to persist edits in configuration files and developed handlers to store relevant properties in the MySQL database. The state of each form became fully manageable and reproducible from the backend. I implemented a tryout view that let users test their form in a simulated frontend. The editor supported conditional logic, multilingual content, semantic HTML editing, and validations — all configurable through the UI. CANVAS evolved into a full-fledged low-code platform enabling editors to independently build accessible, dynamic forms without relying on developers."

The goal was to generate various tax pages (VAT, payroll, dividend, flight tax) modularly based on backend configuration using reusable components and dynamic behavior. I built a set of generic Angular components whose logic and presentation were driven by injectable services and configuration files. Input fields, info blocks, validations, and help texts dynamically adapted based on other component values or backend data. The architecture supported conditional visibility, multilingual labels, and validation rules loaded via JSON schemas. I also implemented frontend filters with dropdowns, search fields, and removable chips. For small tables, I created a wrapper component that enabled client-side sorting without extra backend calls — respecting column types, accessibility, and sorting specs from the BOLD design system. This approach allowed new pages to be rolled out with minimal effort while maintaining WCAG compliance, reusability, and consistency. The architecture proved scalable, maintainable, and reusable for similar portals within the organization."

                "paragraph": "Transdev operated on a legacy Delphi backend, which needed to be made accessible for modern web and mobile applications. I designed and developed a generic API layer (‘API Garden’) using RESTful Web APIs in .NET Core. This API served as a secure and reusable gateway between modern frontends and legacy systems. It incorporated modern security principles, including authentication and authorization at the application level. Thanks to this architecture, external systems could securely and uniformly communicate with the backend. The API Garden marked a key step toward a modular and future-proof application landscape."

                "paragraph": "Travelers calling Transdev's support had no insight into their queue status, which led to frustration and repeated calls. I developed a queue integration module that provided real-time call status using the ICE-lib platform. When a caller was placed in the queue, users received a visual overview of their position and expected wait time. This significantly increased transparency and reduced pressure on the support center. The module was successfully adopted across broader service chains and contributed measurably to improved customer satisfaction."

                "paragraph": "I built an Angular 2 application allowing travelers to check real-time information about bus and taxi trips. The frontend featured accessible, mobile-optimized components built with TypeScript, RxJS, HTML, and CSS. The data was fetched from the API layer and displayed in a user-friendly and intuitive format. The app improved customer self-service and reduced dependency on manual support."
