## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Changes

### Environment Variables

**Removed (No Longer Needed):**

```env
SMTP_USER=hilmar@hilmarvanderveen.com  # Still used as target email
SMTP_PASS=your-office365-app-password  # REMOVED
```

**Required (Microsoft Graph):**

```env
MS_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-app-client-id
MS_CLIENT_SECRET=your-azure-app-client-secret
MS_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id
SMTP_USER=hilmar@hilmarvanderveen.com  # Target email address
```

### Dependencies Cleaned Up

**Removed:**

- `nodemailer` - No longer needed
- `@types/nodemailer` - No longer needed

**Using:**

- `@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client` - For all email operations
- `isomorphic-fetch` - For OAuth token requests

### Code Architecture

**Unified Pattern Across All APIs:**

```typescript
// 1. OAuth 2.0 Token Acquisition
async function getMicrosoftAccessToken(clientId, clientSecret, tenantId);

// 2. Email Sending via Graph
async function sendEmailViaGraph(accessToken, userEmail, emailData);

// 3. Application Authentication (Not Delegated)
await client.api(`/users/${userEmail}/sendMail`).post({ message });
```
