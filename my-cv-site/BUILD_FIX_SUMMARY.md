# Build Fix Summary

## Issue

Vercel build was failing during the "Linting and checking validity of types" phase with TypeScript compilation errors.

## Root Cause

The API routes in `src/app/api/` were using the old Pages API pattern instead of the new App Router API route pattern, causing TypeScript compilation failures.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Contact API Route (`src/app/api/contact/route.ts`)

**Problem:**

- Using Pages API imports: `NextApiRequest`, `NextApiResponse`
- Using `export default function handler` pattern
- Environment variables throwing errors at module level

**Solution:**

- Changed to App Router imports: `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`
- Changed to named export: `export async function POST`
- Moved environment variable validation inside the function
- Added proper error handling for missing environment variables

**Before:**

```typescript
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  // Pages API pattern
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
export async function POST(request: NextRequest): Promise<NextResponse> {
  // App Router pattern
}
```

### 2. Booking API Route (`src/app/api/booking/route.ts`)

**Problem:**

- Environment variables declared at module level with `!` assertion
- Could cause build-time failures when environment variables are not available

**Solution:**

- Moved environment variable access inside the POST function
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Fixed a typo: `createTransporter` → `createTransport`

**Changes:**

- Removed module-level environment variable declarations
- Added runtime environment variable validation
- Improved error messages for missing configuration

## Build Status

✅ **Build now passes successfully**

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success
- Linting: ✅ Success
- Page generation: ✅ Success
- All routes: ✅ Properly configured

## Key Learnings

1. **App Router Pattern:** Next.js 13+ App Router requires specific API route patterns
2. **Environment Variables:** Should be validated at runtime, not module level in API routes
3. **Build Environment:** Vercel build environment may not have all environment variables available during build time

## Impact

- Vercel deployments will now succeed
- API routes are properly configured for production
- Better error handling for missing environment variables
- Consistent App Router architecture throughout the application
